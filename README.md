# Cracking the Coding Interview v6 - ES6

These are the solutions and their respective tests. I'll be updating this repo as I go.

My goal with this project is to become a better technical interviewer. I become a nervous wreck under pressure and employers find it less than desirable.

So... here is my response to struggling in technical interviews.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jacobmoyle/ctci-ES6.git && cd ctci-ES6
```

Run npm:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests

Simply run:
```bash
npm test
```

## Dependencies

- Babel
- Webpack
- Mocha
- Karma
