### What is this? Why are you pushing at 2am?

This repo contains tested solutions for [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=0Y60VYGGXQA2PJ0NPRF3) in addition to data structure and search algorithm notes. This is still in progress.

My goal with this project is to become a better technical interviewer. I become a nervous wreck under pressure and employers find it less than desirable. So... here is my response. It's also a way to stay productive when anxiety keeps me up :tada:.
