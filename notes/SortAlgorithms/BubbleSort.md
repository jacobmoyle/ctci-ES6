Generally one of the very first algorithms learned when you're introduced to this stuff in programming classes. Bubble sort finds the largest value in a set and "bubbles" it to the top. For this visualization, that's the far right side. Everything further along the line than that value gets shifted down one spot, and then the algorithm goes back to the start and finds the next largest value to put at the end of what's left. You can see the unsorted portion slowly being shifted down to the left, one iteration at a time, while the completely sorted portion grows from the right.

1st iteration:
13254
12354

12345
2nd iteration
1234

3rd iteration:

4th iteration:
